TCP Congestion module for nginx.

This module was designed to allow setting of TCP Congestion control on accepted
connections. It may be used to change TCP Congestion control on per-connection
basis for different ip subnets.

Configuration directives:

        tcp_congestion  congestion_control_name;

        Context: http, server, location
        Default: empty string

        Switches tcp congestion control setting and specifies value to use.

Usage:
    http {
        tcp_congestion  reno;

        server {
            tcp_congestion  bbr;
        }
    }
Note that setting TCP congestion control happens at request start and only
if configured, so keepalive connections may inherit control protocol  from
previous request.

To compile nginx with TCP Congestion module use "--add-module <path>" option to
nginx configure.

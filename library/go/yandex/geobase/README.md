# geobase

Geobase is cgo bindings to the C++ geobase library.

This directory contains interfaces and types. Cgo bindings are located inside `internal` directory.
Cgo bindings are generated by SWIG.

## How to add new functions

1. Copy missing method from C++ header, to the `internal/geobase.swg`.
2. Generate swig stubs for IDE.
   ```
   ya make -r -t library/go/yandex/geobase/ --add-result go
   ```
3. Add go mapping code to `cgo.go`, add tests.
4. Provide `DCGO_ENABLED=0` stubs, test build using `ya make -DCGO_ENABLED=0`.

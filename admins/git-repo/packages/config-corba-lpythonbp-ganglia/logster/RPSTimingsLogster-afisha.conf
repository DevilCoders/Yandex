# Example config file for RPSTimingsLogster

# You can override regexp, used to parse log records. 
# It MUST contain "host_name", "http_status_code" and "time" named groups.
# This one is default:

# Default limits to calculate percentels are 75% and 90%, 91%, ..., 100%.
# You can change them in this way:
#ADD_LIMIT = 50
#DEL_LIMIT = 91
#DEL_LIMIT = 92
#DEL_LIMIT = 93
#DEL_LIMIT = 94

# You should define domains, which would be processed by this logster.
# For example:

REGEXP = '\[[^\]]+\] .*afisha\S+ .* \"\w+ (?P<host_name>.*) HTTP/1.\d\" (?P<http_status_code>\d{3}) .*" (?P<time>[0-9\.]+) .* \d+'

/media.* => afisha.yandex.ru-static
(?!/media).* => afisha.yandex.ru-dynamic
.* => afisha.yandex.ru

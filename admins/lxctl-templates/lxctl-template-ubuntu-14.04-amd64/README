Revision number should be set at file "revision" at root of package.

Template files have to be named trusty.tar.gz and trusty-autosetup.tar.gz - they will be copied to package and correct links will be created for them.

=== PUT trusty.tar.gz and trusty-precise.tar.gz in the root of directory, change revision, run dch -i and then debuild. ===

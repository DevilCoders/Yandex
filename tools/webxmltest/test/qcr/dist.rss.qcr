With a crisp crust and a chewy center, they have a hint of sweetness (remember the honey-water). They are, in short, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bootsnall.com/articles/02-02/montreals-bagels-are-they-the-best-in-the-world-montreal-quebec-canada.html&quot;&gt;the best bagels in the world&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing else even comes close&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000625.html#BagelsF1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my parents were alive, every visit was accompanied by four or five dozen, carefully-wrapped and frozen. These went straight into the freezer, to be doled out sparingly, until the next visit. Since then, we (my wife, though born in Chicago, is as passionate about these bagels as I) have been bereft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine my excitement when I learned that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stviateurbagel.com/&quot;&gt;St. Viateur Bagel Bakery&lt;/a&gt; now has a mail-order business. For $31.50 CAN, they’ll send a box of six dozen, via next-day air. &lt;em&gt;Bliss!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas, a quick &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@stviateurbagel.com&quot;&gt;email exchange&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;i lang=&quot;es&quot;&gt;José&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000625.html#BagelsF2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; established that they only ship within Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of demand? The hassle of dealing with US Customs? Pressure from the New York Bagel lobby? Who knows why they won’t ship south of the border! Whatever the reason, I am, needless to say … crushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Update:&lt;/h4&gt; Since this post generated more interest than I thought it would, I offer you, dear readers, a little bit of soft-core bagel porn:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/bagel2.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:195px;height:173px;&quot; alt=&quot;Soft-core bagel porn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Well, OK, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairmountbagel.com/&quot;&gt;the competition&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title base=''>Surprises</title>
   <descr base='http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000624.html'>&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We physicists tend to use ordinary English words, like “energy” or “field” in unconventional, technical ways. Mostly  — even to a layman — it is recognizable, from the context, when a word like “energy” is being used in its technical, rather than its colloquial sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as I was reminded recently, that’s not always true, and can lead to some confusion. In particular, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://steelypips.org/principles/2005_07_24_principlearchive.php?show_id=112255546716585921#a31303a3037706d&quot;&gt;use of the adjective “naïve”&lt;/a&gt; differs significantly from its colloquial meaning. In physics, a “naïve calculation” is one that omits some important effect, or makes some unwarranted simplification that, when properly understood, may significantly change the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which, in turn, reminds me of one of my favourite book, Rudolf Peierls’s &lt;i&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quantumbooks.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;amp;Store_Code=qb&amp;amp;Product_Code=0691082421&quot;&gt;Surprises in Theoretical Physics&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/i&gt; (and its sequel, &lt;i&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quantumbooks.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;amp;Store_Code=qb&amp;amp;Product_Code=0691025223&quot;&gt;More Surprises…&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/i&gt;). It’s a compendium of examples from various branches of Physics, where the naïve calculation yields the wrong answer, followed by a lucid explanation of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; went wrong, and how a correct calculation fixes the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you a taste, here’s a summary of one of my favourite “surprises,” that I sometimes talk about when I teach E&amp;amp;M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why isn’t a free electron gas paramagnetic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a uniform magnetic field, the trajectories of electrons are helices, which project to circles, when projected to the plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. Let v⊥ be the projected velocity. The radius of the circle is
r=mv⊥eB
and the magnetic moment should be ev⊥r, or
μ=mv⊥2 B
(If you want the magnetic susceptibility, you would multiply this by the number density of electrons.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was easy. But, after a moment’s reflection, you realize that it’s complete &lt;em&gt;garbage&lt;/em&gt;. This answer is independent of the electron charge, and it’s &lt;em&gt;inversely&lt;/em&gt; proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. So it diverges for B→0 !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What went wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first answer, as understood by H.A. Lorentz, and by Niels Bohr, is that you really need to think about a finite region. If you pick some rectangle in the plane, those orbits that lie entirely &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the rectangle do not contribute to the magnetic susceptibility of this rectangular region. Those orbits that lie entirely &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the rectangle, contribute paramagnetically, as described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we made a mistake by neglecting the orbits which cross the boundary of the rectangle. We should only consider those portions of these orbits which lie &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the rectangle. These contribute a net current in the opposite sense (clockwise, instead of counterclockwise) from the electrons, whose orbits lie entirely inside the rectangle. This is a small current, but it encloses a large area (nearly the whole rectangle). The upshot, if you do it carefully, is that this boundary current precisely cancels out the effect of the electrons whose orbits lie inside the rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat gnarly calculation, and the sensitive dependence on the boundary conditions makes you think that we’re going about it the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a more robust calculation that yields the same result. The susceptibility
μ=-∂F∂B
where F is the Helmholtz free energy. In Boltzmann Statistics,
Z=e-βF=∫e-βH(r,p)d3 rd3 p
where
H=1 2 m(p-eA)2 +V(r)
and V(r) is the potential energy (which, say, confines the electrons to this rectangular region). The point is that, whereas our previous calculation was highly sensitive to the boundary conditions, calculating the free energy &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; differentiating with respect to B is more robust, as the free energy is much less sensitive to the boundary conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, just by changing variables of integration from p to q=p-eA, we see, immediately, that free energy is independent of B, and hence the susceptibility vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peierls then goes on to discuss Landau’s famous extension of this story to the quantum case. Still neglecting electron spin, one finds (using either Boltzmann statistics, as above, or Fermi-Dirac statistics)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;eqno&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/div&gt;μ=-βℏ2 e2 12 m2 B=-1 3 βμB2 B&lt;p&gt;per electron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, now we see that, neglecting spin, the free electron gas in the quantum case, is &lt;em&gt;diamagnetic&lt;/em&gt;. The magnitude of the above result is 1 /3  the contribution due to electron spin, which is paramagnetic. So, including spin, we expect the electron gas to be &lt;em&gt;paramagnetic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. So that poses another puzzle. Why are some metals &lt;em&gt;diamagnetic&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a periodic potential, the effective mass of the electrons in the conduction band will, in general, not be equal to the free electron mass, m. This shifts the energies of the Landau levels. But the contribution of the spin still depends on the intrinsic magnetic moment, which depends on m. For meff≪m, as in Bismuth, the contribution computed by Landau &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000624.html#SurprisesEq1&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; wins, and one finds a large diamagnetic susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of the “surprises” have as many twists and turns as this one, but it’s all great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

   <title base=''>Noncritical M-Theory?</title>
   <descr base='http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000623.html'>&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting talks I didn’t talk about in my posts about Strings 2005 was by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/audio/05-06/strings/horava/&quot;&gt;Petr Hořava&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0508024&quot;&gt;paper is out&lt;/a&gt;, I should try to make amends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hořava and Keeler propose a “noncritical M-theory” which is the double scaling limit of a 2+1 dimensional nonrelativistic (spinless) fermion in an inverted 2D harmonic oscillator potential. The idea is that certain vacua of this theory correspond to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000206.html&quot;&gt;type 0A and 0B noncritical string theories&lt;/a&gt; in 1+1 dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 0A theory is obtained as follows. Work in polar coordinates, and expand the fermion in creation and annihilation operators
{aq(ω),aq&#39;†(ω&#39;)}=δq,q&#39;δ(ω-ω&#39;)
where q∈ℤ is the angular momentum in the plane. They propose that the OA vacuum with &lt;abbr title=&quot;Ramond-Ramond&quot;&gt;RR&lt;/abbr&gt; charge, q, is obtained by taking the double-scaling limit
N→∞,εF→0 ,NεF=μfixed
and filling the Fermi sea for angular momentum q&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;eqno&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/div&gt;aq(ω)∣0 A〉=0 ,ω&amp;gt;-μaq†(ω)∣0 A〉=0 ,ω&amp;lt;-μ&lt;p&gt;while leaving it &lt;em&gt;empty&lt;/em&gt; for angular momentum q&#39;≠q.
aq&#39;(ω)∣0 A〉=0 ,∀ω&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 0B vacuum is obtained by working in Cartesian coordinates, where the energies of the two (inverted) oscillators are separately conserved. Pick a particular value of ω2 , and fill the Fermi sea for those oscillators with that value of ω2 , while leaving the Fermi sea empty for other values of ω2 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effectively, you reduce the 2D inverted harmonic oscillator to a 1D one, which is the 0B theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this 2+1 D Fermion theory has lots of other interesting vacua that one can contruct in a double scaling limit. Hořava and Keeler discuss some interesting examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the 2+1 dimensional “noncritical M-theory” vacuum arises from filling up the Fermi sea, as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000623.html#NoncriticalMtheoryEq1&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, for all q∈ℤ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s not clear to me, once one has decided to admit states of the 2+1 D theory with rather peculiar normalizability properties, such as these, where one should stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, nothing prevents me from considering an &lt;em&gt;n+1  dimensional&lt;/em&gt; nonrelativistic spinless fermion in an n dimensional inverted harmonic oscillator potential. In appropriate cylindrical or  Cartesian coordinates, I would again recover the 1+1 dimensional 0A/0B string, by an obvious generalization of the above construction. But this theory would have yet-more “interesting” vacua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another paper, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0508023&quot;&gt;also featuring free fermions&lt;/a&gt;, just appeared. It was the subject of  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/audio/05-06/strings/balasubramanian/&quot;&gt;Vijay’s talk&lt;/a&gt;. I should try to say something about that one soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Update:&lt;/h4&gt; Luboš has his own, somewhat sceptical, &lt;a href=&quot;http://motls.blogspot.com/2005/08/non-critical-m-theory.html&quot;&gt;comments on this paper&lt;/a&gt;. He’s rather bothered by the lack of direct connection with other string theory backgrounds. This doesn’t bother me, particularly. I’m more interested in whether there’s a mapping back to a consistent spacetime picture for these theories.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

Some parts of the GUI like ATSServer are still not native to x86 - meaning that Rosetta is required by the GUI, which in turn requires TPM.  See the forum topic &lt;a href=&quot;http://osx86.classicbeta.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=71&quot; title=&quot;http://osx86.classicbeta.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=71&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After much careful analysis of the files from the new Intel-based Macs, it would appear that SSE3 enabled processors are required to run the GUI.  &lt;b&gt;We are still testing this theory, though - nothing has been proven conclusively.&lt;/b&gt;  Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osx86.classicbeta.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=475#475&quot; title=&quot;http://www.osx86.classicbeta.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=475#475&quot;&gt;this forum thread&lt;/a&gt; for evidence and discussion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart people, like Cory Doctorow, are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/31/apple_to_add_trusted.html&quot;&gt;up in arms&lt;/a&gt;, but I don’t really understand how this can succeed in the long run&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000622.html#DarknessF1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MacOSX Kernel is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.opendarwin.org/&quot;&gt;Open-Source&lt;/a&gt;. TPM support is provided by a kernel extension (called &lt;code&gt;TPMACPI.kext&lt;/code&gt;, I gather). Doubtless, when the next version of MacOSX/Darwin is released, this particular kernel extension will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be Open-Source  (unlike the ones which &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.opendarwin.org/index.cgi/src/xnu/iokit/Drivers/&quot;&gt;allow Darwin to boot on generic hardware&lt;/a&gt;.  But who cares? The API provided by this kernel extension will be easy enough to figure out, even assuming that Apple does not save you the trouble by documenting it for use by 3rd party developers. And once you know the API, writing a dummy kernel extension to mimic it on generic x86 hardware will be easy. &lt;em&gt;Oh wait … you mean people are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.research.gwgaming.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&quot;&gt;already working on that&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ve missed some essential point&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000622.html#DarknessF2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I wouldn’t be surprised if a drop-in dummy &lt;code&gt;.kext&lt;/code&gt;, installable by end-users, is available by the time Apple starts shipping x86 Macs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Update:&lt;/h4&gt;  As is clear from the comments below, it’s probably not that hard, after all, for Apple to cripple the GUI on generic x86 hardware, regardless of whether the Kernel and the core OS continue to run. TPM does allow individual Applications, themselves, to authenticate the hardware. That’s all that’s required to prevent some crucial part of the GUI from running on unapproved hardware configurations. ☹&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; To be clear, Doctorow’s complaints are about the evils of &lt;abbr title=&quot;Trusted Computing&quot;&gt;TC&lt;/abbr&gt; generally. In that regard, he’s surely correct. I’m talking only about the ability to boot MacOSX on generic Intel hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; A DMCA lawsuit by Apple would be one possibility I’ve neglected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

   <title base=''>Credit Where Credit is Due</title>
   <descr base='http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000620.html'>&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may recall my previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000589.html&quot;&gt;bemoaning&lt;/a&gt; of the sorry intellectual state of contemporary American conservatism. I did, however, note that there were a couple of &lt;em&gt;exceptions&lt;/em&gt; to the general pattern of cravenness and confusion among the right-wing thinkers and pundits &lt;a href=&quot;http://tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w050704&amp;amp;s=adler070705&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of Evolution and Intelligent Design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Krauthammer and Richard Brookhiser said sensible things. And, now, Krauthammer has written &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/columnist/krauthammer/article/0,9565,1088869,00.html&quot;&gt;an essay&lt;/a&gt; expanding on his response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times do we have to rerun the Scopes “monkey trial”? There are gaps in science everywhere. Are we to fill them all with divinity? There were gaps in Newton’s universe. They were ultimately filled by Einstein’s revisions. There are gaps in Einstein’s universe, great chasms between it and quantum theory. Perhaps they are filled by God. Perhaps not. But it is certainly not science to merely declare it so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To teach faith as science is to undermine the very idea of science, which is the acquisition of new knowledge through hypothesis, experimentation and evidence. To teach it as science is to encourage the supercilious caricature of America as a nation in the thrall of religious authority. To teach it as science is to discredit the welcome recent advances in permitting the public expression of religion. Faith can and should be proclaimed from every mountaintop and city square. But it has no place in science class. To impose it on the teaching of evolution is not just to invite ridicule but to earn it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bravo, Mr. Krauthammer!

Using Niels Leenheer’s very nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rakaz.nl/nucleus/item/103&quot;&gt;guide to upgrading&lt;/a&gt;, it took maybe 5 minutes to upgrade my Atom feed from 0.3 to 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/atom.xml&quot;&gt;old feed&lt;/a&gt;, be forewarned that it &lt;em&gt;will go away&lt;/em&gt; at some point in the not-too-distant future.

   <title base=''>Advice to the Young</title>
   <descr base='http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000612.html'>&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000593.html#c002484&quot;&gt;my response&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000593.html#c002483&quot;&gt;Marty Tysanner&lt;/a&gt;, it occurs to me that, perhaps, he deserves a more lengthy explanation of why I found the notion, that the &lt;em&gt;panel discussion&lt;/em&gt; at String 2005 would affect his choice of what to work on, so utterly wrong-headed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Update (8/1/2005):&lt;/h4&gt; On the off-chance that I’ve failed to convince Marty that he’d be better off throwing &lt;i title=&quot;ancient Chinese method of divination&quot;&gt;I Ching&lt;/i&gt; sticks, he can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/science/02stri.html?ex=1280635200&amp;amp;en=0468e070d884f9ad&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;Dennis Overbye’s summary&lt;/a&gt; of the panel discussion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, one ought to dispel the notion that choosing a speciality to work on is akin to taking Priestly Vows. You should be prepared, indeed even &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt;, to radically change course, perhaps several times during your career. This is not, &lt;a href=&quot;http://motls.blogspot.com/2005/07/next-revolution.html&quot;&gt;contra Luboš Motl&lt;/a&gt;, following fashion. It is an appropriate response to new information. Revolutions (or, at least, small &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;coups d’êtat&lt;/span&gt;) do occur, occasionally and unpredictably, in physics. And you should be prepared to change course accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My own decision, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://motls.blogspot.com/2005/07/next-revolution.html&quot;&gt;so disappointed Luboš&lt;/a&gt;, to change directions midway through graduate school came about as follows. Soon after starting graduate school, I went to see Howard Georgi. “What are you thinking about?” he asked me. I rattled off several things that seemed interesting to me, ending with, “… and quantum gravity.” &lt;strong&gt;“Don’t waste your time!”&lt;/strong&gt; he barked, “There’s no decoupling limit in which it’s sensible to consider quantum gravity effects, while neglecting other interactions. Unless you know particle physics all the way up to the Planck scale, you can never hope to say anything predictive about quantum gravity.” Howard was, of course, completely correct&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000612.html#AdviceF1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And so I bit my lip and dropped quantum gravity from my list of problems to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when string theory came along, it promised a unique (or nearly unique) UV completion of a theory which could accommodate both gravity and the known interactions of particle physics. In a surprising and nontrivial way, Howard’s objection was circumvented. Quantum gravity, at least in the context of string theory, became something sensible to think about. So I reordered my list of priorities…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things which could, just as radically, reorder your list of priorities. If we knew what the “Next Revolution” was going to be, you could, perhaps, prepare yourself for it. Since we don’t, the best you can do is work on what’s seems interesting and important &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, while educating yourself as broadly as possible, so that you’ll at least have a fighting chance when some new and unexpected development comes down the pike. I’m not saying that any significant new development should lead you to up-end your research plans. But it should, at least, lead you to re-examine them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you decide, after all, what to work on? It’s somewhere in that magical intersection of the set of problems which are &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; with the set of problems on which reasonable progress can be made in the short term. New developments can change either of these sets, by making previously intractable problems seem tractable, or by lending new importance to previously uninteresting  (or, perhaps, un-thought-of) questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, again, revolutions which radically alter these sets are inherently unpredictable. The best you can do is focus on those topics that seem most promising, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. For figuring out what those are, I would hope that the &lt;em&gt;talks&lt;/em&gt; at Strings 2005 (if not my woefully inadequate summaries thereof) would be suitable food for thought. Idle speculation about future developments in the field won’t serve you very well&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000612.html#AdviceF2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chatted with several people about their overall impressions of Strings 2005. The consensus was very positive. There were no great surprises, but there was clear progress on a broad array of fronts. My reportage from the conference was spottier than it might otherwise have been, if only the percentage of boring, pointless talks were higher, affording me more “downtime” in which to blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And people are very upbeat about the LHC, and what it might tell us. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://wwwth.cern.ch/lhcOlympics/participants.html&quot;&gt;participant list&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wwwth.cern.ch/lhcOlympics/lhcolympics.html&quot;&gt;LHC Olympics&lt;/a&gt; is studded with well-known young string theorists. If you want my &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; opinion about what would be good for you to be thinking about, that would be one place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, then, you should probably be wary of advice proffered on the internet…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, maybe you should just listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/files/Strings2005.mp3&quot;&gt;Strings 2005 Song&lt;/a&gt;, composed and performed by Brian Wecht, Brook Williams, Nelia Mann, Ted Erler, Matt Lippert, and Nick Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The principle of &lt;em&gt;Universality&lt;/em&gt; — that the same infrared physics allows for multiple, distinct, ultraviolet completions — is what makes effective field theory possible. But it also, ultimately, dooms any attempt to study quantum gravity in a field-theoretic context. Anyone who tells you, “First, I’m going to quantize pure gravity, and then we can add whatever matter and gauge interactions we need, later.” is trying to sell you a bill of goods. Nothing sensible can come from such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Frankly, I’m not sure what purpose they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; serve. Some people professed to find the panel discussion entertaining. Personally, I left midway through. Perhaps with a few beers, I would have found it more amusing. Some grimly sat through the whole thing and &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000593.html#c002467&quot;&gt;were depressed by it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

I’ll try to make partial amends here, but, generally, you’ve have to blame the organizers of Strings 2005 for scheduling so many interesting talks during the latter days of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starinets gave a wonderful survey of the application of the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate hydrodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma. Transport coefficients are not amenable to lattice gauge theory techniques and  weak-coupling perturbative calculations are not of much help. So AdS/CFT, despite the fact that the calculations are done at large-N and strong &#39;t Hooft coupling, in a theory dominated by the =4  UV fixed point, is one of the few theoretical windows we have. He talked about a panoply of results; here are a couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At weak coupling, the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density in the gauge theory is
ηs∼1 g4 log(1 /g2 )≫1 
But, more or less universally in AdS/CFT,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0408095&quot;&gt;one finds&lt;/a&gt;ηs=1 4 π
at strong &#39;t Hooft coupling. This is conjectured to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0405231&quot;&gt;lower-bound&lt;/a&gt;. At finite &#39;t Hooft coupling, λ, one &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0406264&quot;&gt;finds corrections&lt;/a&gt;,
ηs=1 4 π+135 ζ(3 )32 π1 (2 λ)3 /2 +…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, measurements of elliptic flow at RHIC &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312227&quot;&gt;favour small values&lt;/a&gt; for this ratio, seemingly in good accord with the above prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the =4  theory, the sound speed, 
vs=(∂P∂ℰ)1 /2 =1 3 
where P is the pressure, and ℰ is the volume energy density. This follows from conformal invariance; the tracelessness of the stress tensor implies ℰ=3 P. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0305064&quot;&gt;Buchel and Liu&lt;/a&gt; studied the AdS dual of the finite-temperature mass-deformed theory (the so-called =2 * theory, whose zero-temperature limit was studied by &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0004063&quot;&gt;Pilch and Warner&lt;/a&gt;) and, using their solution,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0507026&quot;&gt;Benincasa, Buchel and Starinets&lt;/a&gt; computed the corrections to the sound-speed, and predictions for the bulk viscosity, in the gauge theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Cachazo reviewed the near revolution in perturbative QCD calculations that have taken place in the past year. The insights which flowed from Witten’s reformulation of =4  SYM as a string theory in twistor space continue to pay dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Kraus talked about his &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0506176&quot;&gt;paper with Finn Larsen&lt;/a&gt;, where they provide a robust derivation of the corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the blackhole entropy. Their situation isn’t quite the familiar 4D one, the BPS blackhole in 4 dimensions, whose near-horizon geometry is AdS2 ×S2 . They assume (as happens, say, in 5 dimensions, when you compactify M-theory on a Calabi-Yau), that the near-horizon geometry of the blackhole is AdS3 ×Sp. They then use anomaly arguments to show that the entropy is given by the Cardy formula
S=2 π[cLhL/6 +cRhR/6 ]
where cL,R are the central charges of the CFT on the boundary of AdS3  and hL,R=1 2 (M∓J) are the left- and right-moving momenta of the solution. For cL=cR=c, this central charge is obtained by extremizing a “central charge function”, involving the on-shell action. When cL≠cR, the &lt;em&gt;difference&lt;/em&gt; is entirely determined by the anomalies. What’s cool is that their derivation makes no assumptions about extremality, and so is applicable to a much wider class of blackholes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of other great talks, and the fact that I didn’t discuss them here should not be construed as an editorial comment on my part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

I think perhaps we’ll spend some time  this Fall, in the &lt;b&gt;Geometry and String Theory Seminar&lt;/b&gt; at UT, reviewing this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maldacena and Lunin gave talks about their joint work, some of which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000441.html&quot;&gt;blogged about before&lt;/a&gt;. I won’t repeat what I wrote previously, but there was one remark from Juan’s talk that struck me as an important insight. From the free Fermion description, one gets a rather concrete picture of “summing over nontrivial topologies” on the gravity side. This corresponds to including nontrivial topologies (disconnected dropplets) of the Fermi surface. Juan suggested that small droplets, near an otherwise regular Fermi surface — things that might be called “spacetime foam” — are really indistinguishable from gravitons. Counting them separately from the ripples on the Fermi surface, which are interpreted as gravitons, is overcounting configurations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve long been of the opinion that string theory gives &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; evidence for the popular idea of spacetime foam. Juan’s remark seems to confirm that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

   <title base=''>The Cobbler&#39;s Children</title>
   <descr base='http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000603.html'>&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the disadvantages of chairing a session is that you end up concentrating on the clock, and trying to keep the speakers on schedule, rather than concentrating on the talks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shamit Kachru talked about his beautiful paper with DeWolfe, Giryavets and Taylor on &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0505160&quot;&gt;flux compactifications of Type IIA&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of effort has gone into the study of IIB flux compactifications, and the feeling was that these were somehow “typical” of (but more tractable than) generic string compactifications in which the moduli are stabilized. But these Type IIA flux compactifications behave qualitatively differently. Tadpole cancelation doesn’t produce a bound on the RR four-form flux. So the flux is a free parameter, N, and one finds an &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; family of vacua parameterized by N, accumulating at large radius (R∼N1 /4 ) and weak coupling (gs∼N-3 /4 )&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000603.html#CobblerF1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this (and other) qualitative differences between the IIB and IIA cases, we ought to be circumspect about naïvely hoping that the sorts of behaviour one finds in these backgrounds generalize to other (heterotic, …) classes of compactifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vijay Balasumramanian gave one of his patented enthusiastic talks about some forthcoming work, in which he and collaborators have a rather detailed proposal for the AdS/CFT duals of the microstates of AdS blackholes. These are (multi-)traces of strings of (N2 ) fields in the gauge theory. The claim is that, to “most” probes, these states look precisely thermal. But, to a very few, there is a large, highly non-thermal, response. I hope I have the time to give a detailed account when the paper(s) come out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of my colleagues were visiting Niagra Falls, I spent a few hours this afternoon in the company of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joeclark.org/&quot;&gt;Joe Clark&lt;/a&gt;, which is a whole &#39;nother story …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;And, unlike in Freund-Rubin or related “compactifications”, even these “large-radius” vacua have a clean parametric separation of the Kaluza-Klein modes,
1 /HR∼N1 /2 
from the low-energy 4D degrees of freedom. On the other hand, despite the fact that the string coupling is going to zero and the radius is getting large, Shamit seemed to argue that the tunnelling probability between these vacua &lt;em&gt;is &lt;del&gt;not&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/em&gt; going to zero as N→∞. This is a bit subtle. The domain wall tension, measured in 4D Planck units, goes to zero quite fast at large-N. However, the bulk energy gain goes to zero, as Λ, itself, is going to zero even faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

   <descr base='http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000593.html'>&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toronto is undergoing what the locals consider a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/cities/can/pages/CAON0696.htm&quot;&gt;heat wave&lt;/a&gt;. While the absolute temperatures may not exceed those &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/#links&quot;&gt;in Austin&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a lot more humid here, and air conditioning is less ubiquitous/effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing my random, unsystematic and &lt;em&gt;thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; idiosyncratic reportage…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renata Kallosh talked about flux stabilization on K3 ×K3 . In the presence of fluxes, there are Euclidean D3 instanton (in M-theory, M5 instanton) corrections to the superpotential from divisors of arithmetic genus χ=2 . In the absense of fluxes, only χ=1  contribute instanton corrections (though, in general, positive χ can make “fractional instanton”, AKA gaugino condensate, contributions to the superpotential).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the presence of flux, some of the zero modes &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0507069&quot;&gt;are lifted&lt;/a&gt;, and higher values of χ contribute instanton corrections. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0506014&quot;&gt;Aspinwall and Kallosh&lt;/a&gt; used this to fix all the moduli in compactification of M-Theory on K3 ×K3  (where the relevant divisors, of the form ℙ1 ×K3  and K3 ×ℙ1 , have χ=2 ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomasiello gave a beautiful talk on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0505212&quot;&gt;work with Graña &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on generalized complex geometry and N=1 supersymmetry in Type II compactifications with flux. I’ve meant to blog about Gualtieri and Hitchin’s work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DG/0401221&quot;&gt;Generalized Complex Structures&lt;/a&gt; for a while now. Maybe I’ll get around to it someday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The afternoon was rather phenomenological, with a talk by Witten on axions in string theory and a talk by Arkani-Hamed on LHC physics. The “surprise” of Witten’s talk was that, really, there was no surprise. The axion decay constant, fa, in the “new” string theory backgrounds is really not much different from that in the string backgrounds we knew about 20 years ago. With the notable exception of heterotic backgrounds with anomalous U(1 )s, the typical value of fa∼10 16  GeV. This has always been somewhat in conflict with purported cosmological upper bound, fa≲10 12  GeV (which comes from demanding that axions not dominate the energy density)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000593.html#Strings2005IIf1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, as noted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0303252&quot;&gt;Banks &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this cosmological upper bound is easily evaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkani-Hamed’s talk was a bit more upbeat. The prospects for extracting physics at the LHC are quite exciting. He discussed both “natural” theories (low-energy supersymmetry, little Higgs models, …) and “unnatural” ones (split supersymmetry), and what sort of signatures one could expect. The map, alas, from parameter space, in low-energy supersymmetry, to “signature space” is many-to-one.  Sorting this out is the subject of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wwwth.cern.ch/lhcOlympics/lhcolympics.html&quot;&gt;LHC Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I’m not going to talk about the panel discussion, except to mention Joe Polchinski’s quip about “Anthropic/CFT Duality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The lower bound, fa≳10 9  GeV, coming from supernovæ, seems solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

I hope, at least to use this as an opportunity to make some comments on developments I’d meant to blog about before, but never got around to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/audio/05-06/#strings&quot;&gt;slides are online&lt;/a&gt;, you can check out the other talks yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mathlogo&quot; src=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png&quot; alt=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for more details).&quot; title=&quot;MathML-enabled post (click for details).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eva Silvertein talked about her recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0506130&quot;&gt;paper with McGreevy&lt;/a&gt; about tachyon condensation in big bang/big crunch backgrounds. She and collaborators have written a series of papers  attempting to lay out the case for localized tachyon condensation. Imagine you have a compactification on a manifold M with a nontrivial first homology, H1 (M,ℝ). If&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s some region where the length, l, of the minimal geodesic around this nontrivial cycle is substringy, l&amp;lt;ls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The spin structure of the &lt;em&gt;spacetime&lt;/em&gt; fermions, restricted to this S1  have the bounding spin structure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;then there is a Scherk-Schwarz tachyon localized near this minimal geodesic. From the behaviour under worldsheet RG flow, and by analogy with Liouville theory, they argued that this leads the manifold to &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0502021&quot;&gt;pinch off&lt;/a&gt; this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the more recent paper with McGreevy, this setup is applied to cosmological scenarios, where one has an FRW cosmology, in which the radius of the circle is time-dependent
ds2 =-dt2 +a(t)2 dx⇀2 +ds⊥2 
(one of the x⇀ directions is compactified on a circle). They, again argue that at early (late) times, when l(t)&amp;lt;ls, tachyon condensation — localized in &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; — cuts off the classical big bang (crunch) singularity, replacing it with an intrinsically stringy regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very attractive story, but my inability to make sense of the details kept me from writing about this before. I can’t say that my understanding has improved enough to say anything really insightful now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Verlinde talked about his &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0506180&quot;&gt;paper with Craps and Sethi&lt;/a&gt;. They consider a linear dilaton background, where the dilaton increases linearly along a null direction (producing no net shift in the worldsheet CFT’s central charge). The worldsheet stress tensor looks like
T=-∂X+∂X-+1 2 ∂Xi∂Xi+Q∂2 X+
In the Einstein frame, you clearly see the null singularity
dsE2 =-2 dudv+udxi2 ,ϕ(u)=-2 logu
at u=0 , where u=eQx+/2 , v=2 x-/Q. In the string frame, the metric is flat, but strings become infinitely strongly coupled at u=0 . Lifting to M-theory, one gets
ds11 2 =e-4 3 Qx+dy2 +e2 3 Qx+(-2 dx+dx-+dxi2 )=u-2 dy2 -2 dudv+udxi2 
which also has a null singularity at u=0 , where u=e2 3 Qx+, v=3 2 Qx+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verlinde and collaborators write down a DLCQ matrix string theory for this background,
S=Tr∫dσdτ(DXi)2 +θTDθ+e2 Qτ/RF+e-2 Qτ/R∑[Xi,Xj]2 -e-Qτ/RθTΓi[Xi,θ]
where p+=N/R,  x-=x-+2 πR. This is a U(N) supersymmetric YM theory on a nontrivial 1+1 dimensional manifold, a piece of Milne space. At early times, the effective Yang Mills theory is weakly coupled. At late times, the weakly-coupled string theory is valid. This is an interesting nonperturbative model for the big bang (albeit, with a null, rather than a spacelike singularity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Milne space is non-Hausdorff, so the physics of the SYM theory in this background is going to be a bit … &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</descr>

		<title>The pragmatic’s guide to Web architectures</title>
		<description>There's a big battle of words raging on to define what the hell we're doing and why we're doing it all wrong.
Are Web services on the Web, or do they have to use SOAP? How is low REST different from high REST? Does XML/HTTP work better if we call it ...</description>

		<title>It’s Enterprisey!</title>
		<description>
	The Meme.
	The Architecture. 
	The Wikipedia Entry.
	The Tag.


Recently David Heinemeier-Hanson asked "How do we fork the word enterprise?". This will do for now.

		<title>Ray Ozzie Got the Memo</title>
		<description>I wonder if it's time to adopt a variation of Gandhi's famous formulation: "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win".  It goes something like "First they ignore you, then they keep on ignoring you but you win anyway".  One nice thing ...</description>

		<title>Useful and Useless REST</title>
		<description>With all this talk about High and Low REST, I noticed something in a post by Mark Nottingham:



    Don has effectively made the observation that a lot of other
    people (especially of the Web services sort) have made; while the
    benefits ...</description>

		<title>REST myths</title>
		<description>Today's myth: limiting the number of methods is a good idea.

From an old thread on WebDAV methods: 

&gt; REST encourages the creation of new methods for obscure operations, specifically because we don't want to burden common methods with all of the logic of trying to figure out whether or not ...</description>

		<title>DareвЂ™s $100</title>
		<description>Dare Obasanjo has a great post on [allocating resources][vendor REST support] for XML, HTTP, and REST. The idea is that Don Box has given you an engineering budget, and you're not allowed to steal money from the Web Services department. It goes like this: 

&gt; You have $100 engineering dollars ...</description>

		<title>REST wins, noone goes home</title>
		<description>In public and private people whom I would have never expected, are now getting interested in how to roll out in the REST style. вЂњRestianвЂќ is the term I hear bandied about. Not вЂњRESTfulвЂќ. Not вЂњRESTafarianвЂќ. вЂњRestianвЂќ. I like it.

This is good news, though IвЂ™m a bit taken aback itвЂ™s ...</description>

		<title>“High” REST</title>
		<description>I'd like to follow up Ryan's post with a quick note on what they call high REST. The definition seems to be using GET/POST/PUT/DELETE. Those are the four significant methods in RFC2616, but every other version of HTTP has contained additional methods, and there are no widely deployed applications that ...</description>

		<title>The Highs and Lows of REST</title>
		<description>Discussion on REST seems to be moving in a constructive direction all
over the place with [Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/16/WS-Gartner) 
and [Don Box](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/03/18/20235.aspx)
both contributing. I think [Dare Obasanjo's notes][dare] from [a talk](http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:9oV3TSIAzsEJ:buzz.blogger.com/media/minar-etech-2005.ppt+high-rest&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3) given by Google's
[Nelson Minar](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_spkr/555)

have been floating around for some ...</description>

		<title>A Bigger Soapbox</title>
		<description>SYS-CON Media publisher/editor [Jeremy Geelan][geelan], a fine chap who
interviewed The Father of Java just the other day, contacted me about
re-publishing [Gosling Didn't Get The Memo](http://lesscode.org/2006/03/12/someone-tell-gosling/)
on [sys-con.com](http://sys-con.com). This is the same site that 
published [Gosling's original remarks](http://java.sys-con.com/read/193146.htm). 

It took me about five seconds to agree, within an hour we were
sharing the ...</description>

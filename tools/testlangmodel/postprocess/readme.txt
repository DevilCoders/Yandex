This directory contains useful scripts for evaluating 
results produced by testlangmodel:
    - sortresults.py sorts the output of testlangmodel 
      first by word count, then by score;
    - aggregate.py splits the output into groups  by word count
      and produces a smoothed prob distribution of scores;
    - sidebyside.py takes aggregate files produced by two
      different collections, and generates Excel files for easy
      comparison thereof.

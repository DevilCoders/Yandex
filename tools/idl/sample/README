A basic sample that shows how to use tools-idl-app manually.

Important things to remember:
 1. tools-idl-app requires the presence of various supporting classes and
    methods inside a special "runtime" framework. They are mostly converters
    from platform types to natives, and native-to-platform.

 2. Relative paths to .idl files need to begin with directory corresponding
    to their framework (e.g. foobar/ in this sample).

 3. tools-idl-app is not optimized to be called manually, e.g. arguments
    have no default values.

  title: 'Max File Descriptors'
  description: |-
    Some massive services (e.g. compute) have thousands of instances. 
    When these services are restarted during the deploy, each instance establishes a connection to Access-Service and closes it after the set period of inactivity (3h now). 
    This may cause significant but temporal increase in file descriptors usage, but the situation is expected and normal.

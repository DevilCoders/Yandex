# Whip primaries away

If container supports whipping primary away, calls script through deploy api and waits till all shipments successfully finished.
To whip primary manually you may for example:
![using temporary unreachable](https://jing.yandex-team.ru/files/chapson/2020-09-17_14-07-06.png)

This is useful before any DRILLS tickets, like to whip master away from datacenter.

It also writes logs to container FS.

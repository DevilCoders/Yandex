# replace detail and return?

Guess by Comment, that request is about replacing some part that is not disk with data.
It true, it `approves`. Otherwise `continue`.
Will approve only "profile", not "redeploy" for example.
It's unsafe to approve everything, but we try to approve as much as we think safe.

PS: See 'check_names', 'failure' in https://st.yandex-team.ru/MDB-9452 - Wall-e must document it.
